## Purpose

This matrix serves as a comprehensive gap analysis tool for v4.0 certification.
It combines reverse-engineered features (from 8,603 class declarations) with
aspirational features that customers would reasonably expect from each plugin.

**Verification status (with production readiness %):**
- `[ ] 0%` = Not yet verified
- `[x] 100%` = PASS — feature is fully production-ready
- `[~] NN%` = PARTIAL — exists but needs completion (estimate % done)
- `[!] 0%` = MISSING — gap identified, implementation needed
- `[N/A]` = Not applicable or deferred to v5.0+

**Readiness scoring guide:**
- **100%**: Fully implemented, tested, production-ready, documented
- **80-99%**: Core logic done, needs polish (error handling, edge cases, docs)
- **50-79%**: Partial implementation exists, significant work remaining
- **20-49%**: Scaffolding/strategy exists, core logic not yet implemented
- **1-19%**: Interface/base class exists, no real implementation
- **0%**: Nothing exists, would be new implementation

**Future milestone prioritization (v5.0+):**
- Start from features nearest to 100% (quick wins, minor completion)
- Progress toward 0% features (new implementation)
- This ensures the most value is delivered with the least effort first

**Feature sources:**
- **Code-Derived:** Reverse-engineered from class names, inheritance, and file paths
- **Aspirational (per plugin):** What enterprise/military/hyperscale/developer customers would EXPECT
