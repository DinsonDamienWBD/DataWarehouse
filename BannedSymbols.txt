# BannedSymbols.txt - DataWarehouse SDK
# Phase 22: Minimal initial set targeting clearly dangerous APIs
# Expand in future phases (Phase 23: Cryptographic Hygiene)

# Deprecated Cryptographic Algorithms (broken, must not use)
T:System.Security.Cryptography.MD5; Use SHA256 or higher - MD5 is cryptographically broken
T:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1; Use SHA256 or higher - SHA1 has known collision attacks
T:System.Security.Cryptography.DES; Use AES-256 - DES key size is insufficient
T:System.Security.Cryptography.TripleDES; Use AES-256 - 3DES is deprecated by NIST

# Deprecated Security Types
T:System.Security.SecureString; Deprecated in .NET Core+ - use CryptographicOperations.ZeroMemory instead

# Insecure Random Number Generation (for security-sensitive contexts)
# NOTE: System.Random is used legitimately in non-security contexts (benchmarks, tests, simulations)
# Phase 23 will add BannedApiAnalyzers rules scoped to security-sensitive namespaces
# For now, this is documented but NOT banned globally to avoid false positives
