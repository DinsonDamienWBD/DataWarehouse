# Plan 45-01: Tier 1-2 Verification (Individual + SMB)

## Goal
Verify that DataWarehouse operates correctly for Tier 1 (Individual) and Tier 2 (SMB) deployment scenarios using the **standard preset**. Confirm single-node operations, CLI NLP commands, Dashboard login/browse, USB portable mode, and service installation with `--profile server`.

## Approach
1. Deploy DataWarehouse with `--preset standard` configuration
2. Execute comprehensive smoke tests for Tier 1 and Tier 2 use cases:
   - **Single-node write/read/list/delete**: Verify data pipeline operates correctly on a single machine
   - **CLI NLP commands**: Test natural language interface (`dw "show my files"`, `dw "backup photos"`, etc.)
   - **Dashboard login/browse**: Confirm web UI authentication and data browsing
   - **USB portable mode**: Deploy to USB drive, verify zero-install operation
   - **Service install**: Run `dw service install --profile server`, confirm daemon starts and survives reboot
3. Test Tier 2-specific features:
   - Multi-user access (file shares, basic permissions)
   - Network access to single-node server
   - Scheduled backups
4. Validate configuration presets load correctly (standard.json)
5. Capture logs, metrics, and screenshots for evidence

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- Tier 1: Personal desktop/laptop use cases
- Tier 2: Small office/home office (SOHO) server deployments
- Standard preset validation
- CLI, Dashboard, and portable modes
- Service lifecycle (install, start, stop, uninstall)

**Out of Scope:**
- Multi-node clustering (Tier 3+)
- Advanced security features (Tier 5+)
- Performance benchmarking (Phase 46)
- Penetration testing (Phase 47)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Standard preset loads without errors
- [ ] Single-node write → read → list → delete workflow succeeds
- [ ] CLI NLP commands respond correctly (at least 5 different queries)
- [ ] Dashboard login works, displays data correctly
- [ ] USB portable mode runs without installation, accesses local storage
- [ ] Service installs with `--profile server`, starts on boot, responds to `dw status`
- [ ] Tier 2 multi-user file sharing works (at least 2 concurrent users)
- [ ] All operations logged correctly
- [ ] Zero critical errors in logs

## Output
- `45-01-verification-report.md`: Test results, screenshots, log excerpts
- `45-01-tier1-tier2-evidence.zip`: Logs, config files, screenshots
- Updated `.planning/phases/45-tier-verification/STATUS.md` with pass/fail results
