<objective>
Audit all 8 non-Ultimate plugins and classify each as Standalone (with written rationale) or MergeCandidate (with target plugin and migration plan).

Purpose: Determine which non-Ultimate plugins have a clear standalone justification (unique domain, unique base class, large strategy count) versus which are better absorbed into an existing Ultimate plugin for codebase simplicity.

Output: AUDIT-REPORT.md with classification, rationale, and migration plans for each merge candidate.

NOTE: The ROADMAP says "17 non-Ultimate plugins" but Phase 65.5 already merged 12 plugins (65 -> 53). The actual current count is 8 non-Ultimate plugins:
1. AedsCore (27 files, orchestrator, 0 strategies)
2. PluginMarketplace (7 files, monolithic, 0 strategies)
3. SemanticSync (25 files, 15 strategies)
4. TamperProof (33 files, orchestrator, 0 strategies)
5. Transcoding.Media (35 files, 24 strategies)
6. UniversalDashboards (28 files, 17 strategies)
7. UniversalFabric (25 files, infrastructure, 0 strategies)
8. UniversalObservability (64 files, 57 strategies)

  <name>Task 1: Deep audit of each non-Ultimate plugin for standalone justification</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/82-plugin-consolidation-audit/AUDIT-REPORT.md</files>
  <action>
For each of the 8 non-Ultimate plugins, examine:

1. **Plugin class** -- read the main plugin .cs file, identify base class, registered strategies, lifecycle hooks
2. **Strategy count and uniqueness** -- count strategies, check if they overlap with any Ultimate plugin's domain
3. **Unique SDK contracts** -- check if the plugin implements unique SDK interfaces not covered by any Ultimate plugin
4. **Cross-references** -- grep for references to this plugin from other plugins (message bus topics, type references)
5. **File count and complexity** -- total .cs files, LOC estimate

**Classification criteria:**
- **Standalone** if ANY of: (a) unique base class or SDK contract not served by any Ultimate, (b) 50+ strategies (too large to absorb), (c) orchestrator role that spans multiple Ultimate plugins, (d) distinct bounded context that would reduce cohesion if merged
- **MergeCandidate** if: small strategy count, overlaps an existing Ultimate plugin's domain, and merging increases cohesion

**For each Standalone classification**, write:
- 2-3 sentence rationale explaining why merging would reduce cohesion or break architecture
- Which architectural principle justifies independence (e.g., "orchestrator spanning multiple domains", "unique platform contract")

**For each MergeCandidate classification**, write:
- Target Ultimate plugin (where strategies/code should go)
- Step-by-step migration plan:
  1. Which files/strategies move to target
  2. Namespace changes required
  3. Project reference updates in .slnx
  4. Message bus topic updates (if any)
  5. Delete the standalone project directory

Write the full report to `.planning/phases/82-plugin-consolidation-audit/AUDIT-REPORT.md` with a summary table at the top:

```markdown
# Plugin Consolidation Audit Report

## Summary

| Plugin | Files | Strategies | Classification | Target/Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| AedsCore | 27 | 0 | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. AedsCore
...
```

IMPORTANT: Be thorough. Read actual source code for each plugin. Do not guess based on names alone. Check:
- `Plugins/DataWarehouse.Plugins.AedsCore/` -- all .cs files
- `Plugins/DataWarehouse.Plugins.PluginMarketplace/` -- all .cs files
- `Plugins/DataWarehouse.Plugins.SemanticSync/` -- plugin + strategies
- `Plugins/DataWarehouse.Plugins.TamperProof/` -- all .cs files
- `Plugins/DataWarehouse.Plugins.Transcoding.Media/` -- plugin + strategies
- `Plugins/DataWarehouse.Plugins.UniversalDashboards/` -- plugin + strategies
- `Plugins/DataWarehouse.Plugins.UniversalFabric/` -- all .cs files
- `Plugins/DataWarehouse.Plugins.UniversalObservability/` -- plugin + strategies

Also check `.planning/PLUGIN-CATALOG.md` for each plugin's documented role and v3.0 impact.

AUDIT-REPORT.md exists and contains:
- Summary table with all 8 plugins
- Each plugin has Classification (Standalone or MergeCandidate)
- Each Standalone has written rationale (2-3 sentences minimum)
- Each MergeCandidate has target plugin and step-by-step migration plan
- Verify by reading the file and confirming all 8 plugins are covered

  <done>All 8 non-Ultimate plugins classified with rationale or merge plan. PLUG-01, PLUG-02, PLUG-03 requirements addressed.</done>

- AUDIT-REPORT.md covers all 8 non-Ultimate plugins
- Each classification is backed by evidence from source code examination
- Merge plans are specific enough to execute without further analysis
- Standalone rationales explain architectural justification
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 8 non-Ultimate plugins reviewed and classified
- Standalone plugins have written rationale explaining why merging would reduce cohesion
- Merge candidates have target plugin and step-by-step migration plan
- Report is actionable -- Plan 82-02 can execute merges directly from these plans
