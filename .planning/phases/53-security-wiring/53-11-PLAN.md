<objective>
Verification sweep: confirm all 50 pentest findings are resolved and the codebase builds cleanly.

Purpose: This is the final plan in Phase 53. It does NOT implement new code. It verifies that all previous plans have resolved every finding from the v4.5 pentest report. It produces a verification report cross-referencing each of the 50 findings to the code change that resolved it.

Output: 53-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md confirming all findings resolved; estimated security score; any remaining gaps identified.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build verification and finding-by-finding cross-reference</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
  1. Run full solution build: `dotnet build DataWarehouse.slnx` -- must be 0 errors, 0 warnings
  2. Run all tests: `dotnet test DataWarehouse.slnx` -- all must pass

  3. For EACH of the 50 findings from the pentest report, verify the fix exists in code:

  CRITICAL (8):
  - AUTH-01: grep for "WithAccessEnforcement" in DataWarehouseKernel.cs
  - ISO-01: grep for "sealed.*InjectKernelServices" in PluginBase.cs
  - BUS-01: grep for topic authorization in AccessEnforcementInterceptor/AccessVerificationMatrix
  - DIST-01: grep for membership verification in RaftConsensusEngine.cs
  - DIST-02: grep for sender validation in HandleAppendEntriesAsync
  - NET-01: grep for certificate validation config in GrpcStorageStrategy.cs (no "return true" in cert callback)
  - NET-02: grep for SslCredentials or SecureSsl in GrpcControlPlanePlugin.cs
  - ISO-02: grep for PluginLoader in DataWarehouseKernel.cs (no Assembly.LoadFrom)

  HIGH (20):
  - For each HIGH finding, grep for the specific fix described in plans 01-10
  - Verify each code change exists

  MEDIUM (16) + LOW (8) + INFO (4):
  - Same grep-based verification for each finding

  4. Create the verification report listing every finding, its status, and evidence

  5. Compute estimated security score by domain:
  | Domain | Before | After | Evidence |
  |--------|--------|-------|----------|
  | Access Control | 1/10 | 8/10 | AccessEnforcementInterceptor wired |
  | Message Bus | 1/10 | 8/10 | Rate limiting, HMAC, topic ACL |
  | Distributed | 1/10 | 8/10 | mTLS, HMAC gossip, membership checks |
  | Plugin Isolation | 1/10 | 7/10 | Sealed injection, PluginLoader, timeout |
  | Network Security | 5/10 | 9/10 | All TLS bypasses fixed |
  | Authentication | 4/10 | 8/10 | JWT hardened, API key constant-time |
  | Infrastructure | 5/10 | 8/10 | Audit wired, DLL hijack fixed |
  | Logging/Monitoring | 2/10 | 8/10 | Audit log wired, blind spots filled |
  | (others stable) | ... | ... | ... |

  6. Write verification report to `.planning/phases/53-security-wiring/53-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md`
  </action>
  <verify>
  - `dotnet build DataWarehouse.slnx` returns 0 errors
  - `dotnet test DataWarehouse.slnx` passes all tests
  - 53-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md exists and covers all 50 findings
  </verify>
  <done>
  - All 50 findings cross-referenced to code changes
  - Full solution builds and tests pass
  - Estimated security score computed
  - Verification report created
  - Phase 53 is COMPLETE
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Full solution builds with 0 errors
- All tests pass
- Verification report covers all 50 findings
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- 53-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md exists with status for all 50 findings
- Estimated security posture at 90+/100 (up from 38/100)
- 0 CRITICAL findings remain unresolved
- 0 HIGH findings remain unresolved
- Build and tests clean
</success_criteria>
