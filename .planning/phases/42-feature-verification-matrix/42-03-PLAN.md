- Code-derived: 41 features from UltimateFilesystem, FuseDriver, WinFspDriver
- Aspirational: 35 features customers expect

**Domain 11: Compute & Processing** — 203 items
- Code-derived: 158 features from UltimateCompute, UltimateStorageProcessing, Compute.Wasm
- Aspirational: 45 features customers expect

**Domain 12: Adaptive Transport & Networking** — 537 items
- Code-derived: 452 features from AdaptiveTransport, UltimateDataTransit

**Total items this plan**: 1,107 features

## Tasks

### Task 1: Read Feature Matrix Structure (Domains 9-13)

  - WinFspDriver: WinFsp filesystem driver (Windows)
- Read actual source code (filesystem operations, inode trees, block allocation, FUSE handlers)
- Score each feature (0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-10-filesystem-verification.md`

### Task 4: Verify Domain 11 (Compute & Processing) — 203 features
- For each feature, locate owning plugin:
  - UltimateCompute: 55+ runtime strategies (WASM, Container, GPU, Distributed)
  - UltimateStorageProcessing: 43 storage processing strategies, compute-on-data
  - Compute.Wasm: WebAssembly runtime execution
- Read actual source code (runtime engines, GPU kernels, container orchestration, processing strategies)
- Score each feature (0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-11-compute-verification.md`

### Task 5: Verify Domain 12 (Adaptive Transport & Networking) — 537 features
- For each feature, locate owning plugin:
  - AdaptiveTransport: protocol negotiation, bandwidth-aware switching, transport strategies
  - UltimateDataTransit: chunked, delta, P2P, QoS-aware transfers
- Read actual source code (protocol detection, transport handlers, bandwidth throttling, P2P logic)
- Score each feature (0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-12-transport-verification.md`

### Task 6: Verify Domain 13 (Self-Emulating Objects & Intelligence) — 275 features
- For each feature, locate owning plugin:
  - SelfEmulatingObjects: objects carrying their own processing logic
  - UltimateIntelligence: ML-based intelligence, anomaly detection, embeddings, knowledge graphs
- Read actual source code (SEO serialization, runtime execution, AI providers, vector operations, graph traversal)
- Score each feature (0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-13-intelligence-verification.md`

### Task 7: Generate Summary Report (Domains 9-13)
- Aggregate scores by domain
- Calculate totals:
  - Count by score range (100%, 80-99%, 50-79%, 20-49%, 1-19%, 0%)
  - Percentage distribution
- Identify quick wins (80-99% features)
- Identify significant gaps (50-79% features)
- Record summary to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domains-9-13-summary.md`

## Scoring Guide

**Readiness criteria:**
- **100%**: Fully implemented, tested, production-ready, documented
- **80-99%**: Core logic done, needs polish (error handling, edge cases, docs)
- **50-79%**: Partial implementation exists, significant work remaining
- **20-49%**: Scaffolding/strategy exists, core logic not yet implemented
- **1-19%**: Interface/base class exists, no real implementation
- **0%**: Nothing exists, would be new implementation

**Look for:**
- AirGap features: real USB detection, installer logic, offline validation
- Filesystem features: inode operations, B-tree index, block allocation, FUSE/WinFsp handlers
- Compute features: WASM runtime, container execution, GPU kernels, distributed compute
- Transport features: protocol negotiation, bandwidth detection, QoS policies, P2P routing
- Intelligence features: AI provider integration, embedding generation, knowledge graph traversal
- Real logic vs stubs (`throw new NotImplementedException()` = 0%)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 1,107 features in Domains 9-13 scored with production readiness %
- [ ] Domain verification reports written (5 files)
- [ ] Summary report generated with score distribution
- [ ] Quick wins (80-99%) identified and extracted
- [ ] Significant gaps (50-79%) identified and extracted
- [ ] Findings ready for use in Plans 42-05 and 42-06

## Output

**Verification Reports** (5 files):
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-09-airgap-verification.md`

- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-11-compute-verification.md`
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-12-transport-verification.md`
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-13-intelligence-verification.md`

**Summary Report**:
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domains-9-13-summary.md`

**Format** (per verification report):
```markdown
# Domain N: [Name] Verification Report

## Summary
- Total Features: NNN

- Average Score: NN%

## Score Distribution
| Range | Count | % |
|-------|-------|---|
| 100% | NN | NN% |
| 80-99% | NN | NN% |
| 50-79% | NN | NN% |
| 20-49% | NN | NN% |
| 1-19% | NN | NN% |
| 0% | NN | NN% |

## Feature Scores

### Plugin: [Plugin Name]

- [~] NN% Feature Name — (Source: Plugin X)
  - **Location**: `Plugins/X/Strategies/FeatureStrategy.cs`
  - **Status**: [Core logic done | Partial | Scaffolding only | Missing]
  - **Gaps**: [Error handling missing | No tests | No docs | etc.]

[... for each feature ...]
```

## Dependencies

None (Wave 1, runs in parallel with 42-01, 42-02, 42-04)

## Notes

- This is verification work, NOT implementation
- Read actual source code to determine scores (no guessing)
- AirGap features are critical for military tier (Tier 6) — verify thoroughly
- Transport domain has 537 features (largest single domain) — expect variety in scores
- Intelligence features depend on AI provider integration — check for real API calls vs stubs
- Conservative scoring: if unsure between two ranges, choose lower score
