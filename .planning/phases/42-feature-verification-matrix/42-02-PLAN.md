# Plan 42-02: Feature Verification — Domains 5-8 (Distributed, Hardware, Edge, AEDS)

## Goal

Assess production readiness for all features in the Feature Verification Matrix under Domains 5-8, scoring each feature from 0-100% based on actual implementation status.

## Scope

**Domain 5: Distributed Systems & Replication** — 161 items
- Code-derived: 131 features from UltimateReplication, UltimateConsensus, UltimateResilience
- Aspirational: 30 features customers expect

**Domain 6: Hardware & Platform Integration** — 49 items
- Code-derived: 29 features from SDK Hardware layer, deployment profiles
- Aspirational: 20 features customers expect

**Domain 7: Edge / IoT** — 94 items
- Code-derived: 59 features from SDK Edge layer, UltimateEdgeComputing, UltimateIoTIntegration
- Aspirational: 35 features customers expect

**Domain 8: AEDS & Service Architecture** — 49 items
- Code-derived: 19 features from AedsCore (ServerDispatcher + ClientCourier + control/data planes)
- Aspirational: 30 features customers expect

**Total items this plan**: 353 features

## Tasks

### Task 1: Read Feature Matrix Structure (Domains 5-8)
- Read `Metadata/FeatureVerificationMatrix.md` lines 1438-1846 (Domains 5-8)
- Extract all feature items with their source attribution
- Build feature-to-plugin mapping

### Task 2: Verify Domain 5 (Distributed Systems & Replication) — 161 features
- For each feature, locate owning plugin:
  - UltimateReplication: multi-master, active-passive, geo-dispersed WORM
  - UltimateConsensus: Multi-Raft, DVV, CRDT (GCounter, PNCounter, LWWRegister, ORSet)
  - UltimateResilience: circuit breakers, bulkhead isolation, retry policies
- Read actual source code (consensus algorithms, replication handlers, resilience strategies)
- Score each feature (0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-05-distributed-verification.md`

### Task 3: Verify Domain 6 (Hardware & Platform Integration) — 49 features
- For each feature, locate owning component:
  - SDK Hardware layer: NVMe passthrough, NUMA-aware allocation
  - Platform probes: WMI (Windows), sysfs (Linux), system_profiler (macOS)
  - Hardware accelerators: Intel QAT, GPU (CUDA/ROCm), TPM2, HSM
  - Hypervisor detection: balloon driver, paravirt I/O
  - Deployment profiles: hosted, hypervisor, bare-metal, hyperscale, edge
- Read actual source code
- Score each feature (0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-06-hardware-verification.md`

### Task 4: Verify Domain 7 (Edge / IoT) — 94 features
- For each feature, locate owning plugin:
  - SDK Edge layer: GPIO, I2C, SPI bus controllers
  - UltimateEdgeComputing: digital twins, edge orchestration, sensor fusion
  - UltimateIoTIntegration: MQTT, CoAP, BLE mesh, LoRa mesh, Zigbee
- Read actual source code (bus controllers, mesh protocols, digital twin logic)
- Score each feature (0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-07-edge-verification.md`

### Task 5: Verify Domain 8 (AEDS & Service Architecture) — 49 features
- For each feature, locate owning plugin:
  - AedsCore.ServerDispatcherPlugin: job queue, client registration, distribution channels
  - AedsCore.ClientCourierPlugin: Sentinel, Executor, Watchdog, Policy Engine
  - Control plane plugins: gRPC, MQTT, WebSocket
  - Data plane plugins: HTTP/2, HTTP/3, QUIC, WebTransport
  - Actions: Passive, Notify, Execute, Interactive, Custom
- Read actual source code (dispatcher logic, courier components, channel implementations)
- Score each feature (0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-08-aeds-verification.md`

### Task 6: Generate Summary Report (Domains 5-8)
- Aggregate scores by domain
- Calculate totals:
  - Count by score range (100%, 80-99%, 50-79%, 20-49%, 1-19%, 0%)
  - Percentage distribution
- Identify quick wins (80-99% features)
- Identify significant gaps (50-79% features)
- Record summary to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domains-5-8-summary.md`

## Scoring Guide

**Readiness criteria:**
- **100%**: Fully implemented, tested, production-ready, documented
- **80-99%**: Core logic done, needs polish (error handling, edge cases, docs)
- **50-79%**: Partial implementation exists, significant work remaining
- **20-49%**: Scaffolding/strategy exists, core logic not yet implemented
- **1-19%**: Interface/base class exists, no real implementation
- **0%**: Nothing exists, would be new implementation

**Look for:**
- Consensus algorithms (Raft log replication, leader election, DVV pruning)
- Replication handlers (sync/async, conflict resolution)
- Resilience policies (circuit breaker state machines, retry exponential backoff)
- Hardware probes (P/Invoke, WMI calls, sysfs parsing)
- Edge protocols (MQTT client, CoAP client, mesh networking)
- AEDS components (ServerDispatcher job queue, ClientCourier executor)
- Real logic vs stubs (`throw new NotImplementedException()` = 0%)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 353 features in Domains 5-8 scored with production readiness %
- [ ] Domain verification reports written (4 files)
- [ ] Summary report generated with score distribution
- [ ] Quick wins (80-99%) identified and extracted
- [ ] Significant gaps (50-79%) identified and extracted
- [ ] Findings ready for use in Plans 42-05 and 42-06

## Output

**Verification Reports** (4 files):
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-05-distributed-verification.md`
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-06-hardware-verification.md`
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-07-edge-verification.md`
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-08-aeds-verification.md`

**Summary Report**:
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domains-5-8-summary.md`

**Format** (per verification report):
```markdown
# Domain N: [Name] Verification Report

## Summary
- Total Features: NNN
- Code-Derived: NNN
- Aspirational: NNN
- Average Score: NN%

## Score Distribution
| Range | Count | % |
|-------|-------|---|
| 100% | NN | NN% |
| 80-99% | NN | NN% |
| 50-79% | NN | NN% |
| 20-49% | NN | NN% |
| 1-19% | NN | NN% |
| 0% | NN | NN% |

## Feature Scores

### Plugin: [Plugin Name]

- [~] NN% Feature Name — (Source: Plugin X)
  - **Location**: `Plugins/X/Strategies/FeatureStrategy.cs`
  - **Status**: [Core logic done | Partial | Scaffolding only | Missing]
  - **Gaps**: [Error handling missing | No tests | No docs | etc.]

[... for each feature ...]
```

## Dependencies

None (Wave 1, runs in parallel with 42-01, 42-03, 42-04)

## Notes

- This is verification work, NOT implementation
- Read actual source code to determine scores (no guessing)
- Hardware features may be lower scores (platform-specific, harder to implement)
- Edge/IoT features may have protocol stubs (MQTT client exists, mesh may not)
- AEDS is critical architecture — verify thoroughly (server + client profiles)
- Conservative scoring: if unsure between two ranges, choose lower score
