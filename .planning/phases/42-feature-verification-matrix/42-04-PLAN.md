# Plan 42-04: Feature Verification — Domains 14-17 (Observability, Governance, Cloud, CLI/GUI)

## Goal

Assess production readiness for all features in the Feature Verification Matrix under Domains 14-17, scoring each feature from 0-100% based on actual implementation status.

## Scope

**Domain 14: Observability & Operations** — 164 items
- Code-derived: 129 features from UniversalObservability
- Aspirational: 35 features customers expect

**Domain 15: Data Governance & Compliance** — 644 items
- Code-derived: 549 features from UltimateDataGovernance, UltimateCompliance, UltimateDataPrivacy, UltimateDataProtection, UltimateDataQuality, UltimateDataLineage, UltimateDataCatalog, UltimateDataManagement
- Aspirational: 95 features customers expect

**Domain 16: Docker / Kubernetes / Cloud** — 207 items
- Code-derived: 162 features from UltimateDeployment, UltimateMultiCloud, KubernetesCsi
- Aspirational: 45 features customers expect

**Domain 17: CLI & GUI Dynamic Intelligence** — 42 items
- Code-derived: 2 features from DataWarehouse.CLI, DataWarehouse.GUI
- Aspirational: 40 features customers expect

**Total items this plan**: 1,057 features

## Tasks

### Task 1: Read Feature Matrix Structure (Domains 14-17)
- Read `Metadata/FeatureVerificationMatrix.md` lines 3035-4164 (Domains 14-17)
- Extract all feature items with their source attribution
- Build feature-to-plugin mapping

### Task 2: Verify Domain 14 (Observability & Operations) — 164 features
- For each feature, locate owning plugin:
  - UniversalObservability: 55 strategies (Prometheus, Jaeger, OTEL, Datadog, custom exporters)
- Read actual source code (metrics exporters, tracing integrations, health checks, alerting)
- Score each feature (0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-14-observability-verification.md`

### Task 3: Verify Domain 15 (Data Governance & Compliance) — 644 features
- For each feature, locate owning plugin:
  - UltimateDataGovernance: governance policies, enforcement
  - UltimateCompliance: GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, FedRAMP (160 files)
  - UltimateDataPrivacy: PII detection, anonymization, differential privacy
  - UltimateDataProtection: data protection policies, retention, classification
  - UltimateDataQuality: predictive quality monitoring, profiling
  - UltimateDataLineage: BFS lineage traversal, upstream/downstream tracking
  - UltimateDataCatalog: living data asset catalog
  - UltimateDataManagement: tenant-scoped data management
- Read actual source code (governance engines, compliance validators, privacy algorithms, lineage graphs)
- Score each feature (0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-15-governance-verification.md`

### Task 4: Verify Domain 16 (Docker / Kubernetes / Cloud) — 207 features
- For each feature, locate owning plugin:
  - UltimateDeployment: Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling, A/B, K8s, Docker, Terraform
  - UltimateMultiCloud: AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba, Oracle hybrid cloud
  - KubernetesCsi: CSI driver for K8s persistent volumes
- Read actual source code (deployment strategies, cloud adapters, CSI handlers)
- Score each feature (0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-16-cloud-verification.md`

### Task 5: Verify Domain 17 (CLI & GUI Dynamic Intelligence) — 42 features
- For each feature, locate owning project:
  - DataWarehouse.CLI: command-line interface, natural language processing
  - DataWarehouse.GUI: desktop application (WPF/cross-platform)
- Read actual source code (CLI command handlers, NLP parsing, GUI dynamic rendering)
- Score each feature (0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-17-cli-gui-verification.md`

### Task 6: Generate Summary Report (Domains 14-17)
- Aggregate scores by domain
- Calculate totals:
  - Count by score range (100%, 80-99%, 50-79%, 20-49%, 1-19%, 0%)
  - Percentage distribution
- Identify quick wins (80-99% features)
- Identify significant gaps (50-79% features)
- Record summary to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domains-14-17-summary.md`

## Scoring Guide

**Readiness criteria:**
- **100%**: Fully implemented, tested, production-ready, documented
- **80-99%**: Core logic done, needs polish (error handling, edge cases, docs)
- **50-79%**: Partial implementation exists, significant work remaining
- **20-49%**: Scaffolding/strategy exists, core logic not yet implemented
- **1-19%**: Interface/base class exists, no real implementation
- **0%**: Nothing exists, would be new implementation

**Look for:**
- Observability features: real exporters (Prometheus metrics, Jaeger traces, OTEL integration)
- Governance features: policy engines, compliance validators, lineage graph traversal
- Cloud features: real cloud API calls (AWS SDK, Azure SDK, GCP SDK), deployment automation
- CLI/GUI features: command handlers, NLP parsers, dynamic UI rendering
- Real logic vs stubs (`throw new NotImplementedException()` = 0%)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 1,057 features in Domains 14-17 scored with production readiness %
- [ ] Domain verification reports written (4 files)
- [ ] Summary report generated with score distribution
- [ ] Quick wins (80-99%) identified and extracted
- [ ] Significant gaps (50-79%) identified and extracted
- [ ] Findings ready for use in Plans 42-05 and 42-06

## Output

**Verification Reports** (4 files):
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-14-observability-verification.md`
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-15-governance-verification.md`
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-16-cloud-verification.md`
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-17-cli-gui-verification.md`

**Summary Report**:
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domains-14-17-summary.md`

**Format** (per verification report):
```markdown
# Domain N: [Name] Verification Report

## Summary
- Total Features: NNN
- Code-Derived: NNN
- Aspirational: NNN
- Average Score: NN%

## Score Distribution
| Range | Count | % |
|-------|-------|---|
| 100% | NN | NN% |
| 80-99% | NN | NN% |
| 50-79% | NN | NN% |
| 20-49% | NN | NN% |
| 1-19% | NN | NN% |
| 0% | NN | NN% |

## Feature Scores

### Plugin: [Plugin Name]

- [~] NN% Feature Name — (Source: Plugin X)
  - **Location**: `Plugins/X/Strategies/FeatureStrategy.cs`
  - **Status**: [Core logic done | Partial | Scaffolding only | Missing]
  - **Gaps**: [Error handling missing | No tests | No docs | etc.]

[... for each feature ...]
```

## Dependencies

None (Wave 1, runs in parallel with 42-01, 42-02, 42-03)

## Notes

- This is verification work, NOT implementation
- Read actual source code to determine scores (no guessing)
- Domain 15 (Governance) has 644 features (largest domain) — expect significant work
- Compliance features (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) may be high scores due to Phase 31.1 work
- CLI/GUI domain has 2 code-derived features (low) + 40 aspirational (high) — expect low scores
- Cloud features require real SDK integration — check for actual API calls vs stubs
- Conservative scoring: if unsure between two ranges, choose lower score
