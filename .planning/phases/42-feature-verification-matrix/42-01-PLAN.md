# Plan 42-01: Feature Verification — Domains 1-4 (Data Pipeline, Storage, Security, Media)

## Goal

Assess production readiness for all features in the Feature Verification Matrix under Domains 1-4, scoring each feature from 0-100% based on actual implementation status.

## Scope

**Domain 1: Data Pipeline (Write/Read/Process)** — 362 items
- Code-derived: 252 features from UltimateCompression, UltimateEncryption, UltimateStorage, UltimateDataIntegration, UltimateStreamingData, UltimateWorkflow
- Aspirational: 110 features customers expect

**Domain 2: Storage & Persistence** — 447 items
- Code-derived: 377 features from UltimateStorage, UltimateRAID, UltimateDatabaseStorage, UltimateFilesystem
- Aspirational: 70 features customers expect

**Domain 3: Security & Cryptography** — 387 items
- Code-derived: 307 features from UltimateEncryption, UltimateKeyManagement, UltimateAccessControl, TamperProof, UltimateDataIntegrity, UltimateBlockchain
- Aspirational: 80 features customers expect

**Domain 4: Media & Format Processing** — 95 items
- Code-derived: 60 features from Transcoding.Media, UltimateDataFormat
- Aspirational: 35 features customers expect

**Total items this plan**: 1,291 features

## Tasks

### Task 1: Read Feature Matrix Structure (Domains 1-4)
- Read `Metadata/FeatureVerificationMatrix.md` lines 67-1437 (Domains 1-4)
- Extract all feature items with their source attribution
- Build feature-to-plugin mapping

### Task 2: Verify Domain 1 (Data Pipeline) — 362 features
- For each feature, locate owning plugin:
  - UltimateCompression: compression strategies (Brotli, LZ4, Zstd, etc.)
  - UltimateEncryption: encryption in pipeline
  - UltimateStorage: storage backends
  - UltimateDataIntegration: ETL, CDC, streaming integration
  - UltimateStreamingData: real-time processing, windowing, backpressure
  - UltimateWorkflow: DAG orchestration, retry, state management
- Read actual source code (strategies, base classes, handlers)
- Score each feature:
  - **100%**: Fully implemented, tested, production-ready
  - **80-99%**: Core logic done, needs polish (error handling, edge cases, docs)
  - **50-79%**: Partial implementation, significant work remaining
  - **20-49%**: Scaffolding exists, core logic not yet implemented
  - **1-19%**: Interface/base class exists, no real implementation
  - **0%**: Nothing exists, would be new implementation
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-01-pipeline-verification.md`

### Task 3: Verify Domain 2 (Storage & Persistence) — 447 features
- For each feature, locate owning plugin:
  - UltimateStorage: 130+ storage backends (file, S3, Azure Blob, NFS, etc.)
  - UltimateRAID: 50+ RAID strategies, self-healing, erasure coding
  - UltimateDatabaseStorage: graph, time-series, document, key-value
  - UltimateFilesystem: virtual filesystem, B-tree index, block devices
- Read actual source code
- Score each feature (same 0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-02-storage-verification.md`

### Task 4: Verify Domain 3 (Security & Cryptography) — 387 features
- For each feature, locate owning plugin:
  - UltimateEncryption: 30+ encryption algorithms (AES-GCM, ChaCha20, post-quantum)
  - UltimateKeyManagement: 30+ key store strategies (file, HSM, FROST, post-quantum)
  - UltimateAccessControl: 9 access control models + 10 identity + 8 MFA + Zero Trust
  - TamperProof: blockchain anchoring, Merkle trees, hash chains, WORM
  - UltimateDataIntegrity: 15 hash providers
  - UltimateBlockchain: Ethereum, Solana, IPFS integration
- Read actual source code
- Score each feature (same 0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-03-security-verification.md`

### Task 5: Verify Domain 4 (Media & Format Processing) — 95 features
- For each feature, locate owning plugin:
  - Transcoding.Media: video/image/audio transcoding, codec support
  - UltimateDataFormat: scientific, healthcare, geospatial, graph formats
- Read actual source code
- Score each feature (same 0-100% scale)
- Record findings to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-04-media-verification.md`

### Task 6: Generate Summary Report (Domains 1-4)
- Aggregate scores by domain
- Calculate totals:
  - Count by score range (100%, 80-99%, 50-79%, 20-49%, 1-19%, 0%)
  - Percentage distribution
- Identify quick wins (80-99% features)
- Identify significant gaps (50-79% features)
- Record summary to `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domains-1-4-summary.md`

## Scoring Guide

**Readiness criteria:**
- **100%**: Fully implemented, tested, production-ready, documented
- **80-99%**: Core logic done, needs polish (error handling, edge cases, docs)
- **50-79%**: Partial implementation exists, significant work remaining
- **20-49%**: Scaffolding/strategy exists, core logic not yet implemented
- **1-19%**: Interface/base class exists, no real implementation
- **0%**: Nothing exists, would be new implementation

**Look for:**
- Strategy classes (e.g., `BrotliCompressionStrategy`, `AesGcmEncryptionStrategy`)
- Base classes (e.g., `CompressionStrategyBase`, `EncryptionStrategyBase`)
- Handlers (e.g., `WritePhase1Handler`, `ReadPhase2Handler`)
- Real logic vs stubs (`throw new NotImplementedException()` = 0%)
- Error handling, validation, logging (if missing, reduce score 10-20%)
- Tests (if missing, reduce score 10-20%)
- XML documentation (if missing, reduce score 5-10%)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 1,291 features in Domains 1-4 scored with production readiness %
- [ ] Domain verification reports written (4 files)
- [ ] Summary report generated with score distribution
- [ ] Quick wins (80-99%) identified and extracted
- [ ] Significant gaps (50-79%) identified and extracted
- [ ] Findings ready for use in Plans 42-05 and 42-06

## Output

**Verification Reports** (4 files):
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-01-pipeline-verification.md`
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-02-storage-verification.md`
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-03-security-verification.md`
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domain-04-media-verification.md`

**Summary Report**:
- `.planning/phases/42-feature-verification-matrix/domains-1-4-summary.md`

**Format** (per verification report):
```markdown

- [~] NN% Feature Name — (Source: Plugin X)
  - **Location**: `Plugins/X/Strategies/FeatureStrategy.cs`
  - **Status**: [Core logic done | Partial | Scaffolding only | Missing]
  - **Gaps**: [Error handling missing | No tests | No docs | etc.]

[... for each feature ...]

## Dependencies

None (Wave 1, starts immediately)

## Notes

- This is verification work, NOT implementation
- Read actual source code to determine scores (no guessing)
- Be honest about gaps (better to find them now than in hostile audit)
- Document findings precisely (Plan 42-05/42-06 will use this data)
- Conservative scoring: if unsure between two ranges, choose lower score
