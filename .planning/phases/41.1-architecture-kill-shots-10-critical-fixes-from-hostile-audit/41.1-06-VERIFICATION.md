## Deprecation Warnings

Expected deprecation warnings when VectorClock or Raft plugin is referenced:

- `VectorClock` (record in `IMultiMasterReplication.cs`): [Obsolete] - use DottedVersionVector
- `VectorClock` (class in `ReplicationStrategy.cs`): [Obsolete] - use DottedVersionVector
- `RaftConsensusPlugin`: [Obsolete] - replaced by UltimateConsensus Multi-Raft

These are warnings (not errors) for gradual migration.

## Checklist

- [x] DVV: IReplicationClusterMembership.cs exists in SDK/Replication/
- [x] DVV: DottedVersionVector.cs with Increment, HappensBefore, Merge, IsConcurrent, PruneDeadNodes
- [x] DVV: Membership callbacks wired, auto-prune on node removal
- [x] VectorClock: [Obsolete] markers on both definitions
- [x] ConsensusPluginBase: enhanced with ConsensusResult, ConsensusState, ClusterHealthInfo records
- [x] ConsensusPluginBase: ProposeAsync(byte[], ct), IsLeaderAsync, GetStateAsync, GetClusterHealthAsync
- [x] ResiliencePluginBase: exists in SDK/Contracts/Hierarchy/Feature/, extends InfrastructurePluginBase
- [x] ResiliencePluginBase: ExecuteWithResilienceAsync<T>, GetResilienceHealthAsync, ResilienceHealthInfo
- [x] UltimateConsensus: plugin project created, added to solution
- [x] UltimateConsensus: Multi-Raft with ConcurrentDictionary<int, RaftGroup>
- [x] UltimateConsensus: Leader election, log replication, snapshots functional
- [x] UltimateConsensus: ConsistentHash (jump hash) for group routing
- [x] UltimateResilience: refactored to extend ResiliencePluginBase
- [x] Raft plugin: [Obsolete] marker added
- [x] Tests: DVV tests pass (12/12)
- [x] Tests: UltimateConsensus tests pass (16/16)
- [x] Build: All affected projects build with zero errors
- [x] No placeholders: all code production-ready (except Paxos/PBFT/ZAB stubs per plan scope)
