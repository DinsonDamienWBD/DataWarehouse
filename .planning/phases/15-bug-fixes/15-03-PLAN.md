<objective>
Verify that all TODO/FIXME/HACK comments have been resolved in the codebase.

Purpose: The ROADMAP originally estimated "36+ TODO comments" but research found ZERO in any .cs file. This plan performs a comprehensive final scan across all source file types to confirm the codebase is clean, then closes the BUG-02 requirement.

Output: Verification evidence that zero TODO comments remain; BUG-02 marked satisfied.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Comprehensive TODO/FIXME/HACK scan across all source files</name>
  <files>
    (scan only, no modifications expected)
  </files>
  <action>
    Run exhaustive scans for actionable code comments across ALL source file types:

    1. **C# source files (.cs):**
       - Search for patterns: `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `BUG`, `XXX`, `WORKAROUND`, `TEMP`, `KLUDGE`
       - Case-insensitive search in all .cs files under the repository root
       - Exclude: comments that are part of XML documentation explaining what a TODO tracker task does (e.g., "This implements T26 which was a TODO item")

    2. **Build/config files (.csproj, .props, .targets, .sln, .slnx):**
       - Search for TODO/FIXME/HACK patterns in build configuration files
       - These sometimes contain temporary workarounds

    3. **XAML/Razor files (.xaml, .razor, .cshtml):**
       - Search for TODO/FIXME comments in UI markup files

    4. **Script files (.ps1, .sh, .cmd, .bat):**
       - Search for TODO/FIXME in any automation scripts

    For each scan, record:
    - Total files scanned
    - Matches found (if any)
    - File path and line number for any matches

    If ANY actionable TODO/FIXME/HACK comments are found:
    - Evaluate if the TODO describes work that is already complete (remove the comment)
    - Evaluate if the TODO describes work tracked in TODO.md (remove the comment, work is tracked)
    - Evaluate if the TODO describes a genuine gap (document it, do NOT silently remove)
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run search for TODO in all .cs files -- expect 0 results.
    Run search for FIXME in all .cs files -- expect 0 results.
    Run search for HACK in all .cs files -- expect 0 results.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Comprehensive scan confirms zero actionable TODO/FIXME/HACK/BUG/XXX comments in any source file type (.cs, .csproj, .xaml, .razor, scripts). If any were found, they have been resolved or documented.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Close BUG-02 requirement and update TODO.md</name>
  <files>
    Metadata/TODO.md
  </files>
  <action>
    Based on verification results from Task 1:

    1. Update Metadata/TODO.md to mark the TODO-comment resolution task as complete:
       - Find any sub-tasks related to "resolve TODO comments" or "code cleanup comments"
       - Mark them as [x] Complete with date 2026-02-11

    2. Document the verification evidence:
       - Record in the SUMMARY that the original ROADMAP estimate of "36+ TODO comments" was outdated
       - Actual count: 0 TODO comments found in current codebase
       - The comments were either cleaned up during previous phases or never existed in the current branch

    3. Confirm BUG-02 requirement satisfaction:
       - BUG-02 requires all TODO comments addressed or converted to tracked tasks
       - With 0 TODO comments found, BUG-02 is satisfied by verification
  </action>
  <verify>
    Grep for `TODO` in Metadata/TODO.md to confirm the task is marked [x] (note: "TODO" in TODO.md itself is expected as the filename/content references task IDs).
  </verify>
  <done>
    BUG-02 requirement satisfied: zero TODO/FIXME/HACK comments exist in any source files. TODO.md updated with completion status.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

- Exhaustive search across .cs, .csproj, .xaml, .razor, script files finds zero actionable TODO/FIXME/HACK comments

<success_criteria>
- Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in source files (verified by search)
