<objective>
Update the v4.5 competitive analysis against 70+ products to reflect v5.0 capabilities including 10 moonshot features, security improvements, and feature gap closures.

Purpose: Provide an honest, updated competitive positioning document that reflects what v5.0 actually delivers versus the industry.

  <name>Task 1: v5.0 Delta Assessment and Competitive Update</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/67-certification/67-06-COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md</files>
  <action>
    Using the v4.5 competitive analysis (Part 2 of v4.5-CERTIFICATION.md) as baseline, update every comparison to reflect v5.0 improvements:

    **A. Identify v5.0 Deltas:**

    From the audit summaries (Plans 01-05), compile what changed between v4.5 and v5.0:
    - Security score improvement (38/100 -> ?/100)
    - Feature gap closures (3,549 features)
    - 10 moonshot features added
    - Test count improvement (1,308 -> 1,511+)
    - New capabilities: Universal Tags, Data Consciousness, Compliance Passports, Zero-Gravity Storage, Crypto Time-Locks, Semantic Sync, Chaos Vaccination, Carbon-Aware Tiering, Universal Fabric, S3 Server

    **B. Update All 11 Categories (70+ products):**

    For each category from v4.5, update "What DW does better" and "Critical gaps":

    1. **NAS/Storage Appliance OS** (TrueNAS, Synology, QNAP, OMV, etc.) -- Does S3 Server / Universal Fabric change the comparison?
    2. **Distributed/Object Storage** (Ceph, MinIO, GlusterFS) -- Does CRUSH placement / Zero-Gravity change the comparison? Does S3 server close the "S3 consumer not server" gap?
    3. **Security-Hardened OS** (INTEGRITY-178B, QNX, OpenBSD) -- Does security score improvement change the comparison?
    4. **RTOS/Embedded** (VxWorks, LynxOS) -- Any change?
    5. **Data Platforms/Lakehouses** (Snowflake, Databricks, Cloudera) -- Does Query Engine or Data Consciousness change the comparison?
    6. **Enterprise Backup** (Veeam, Commvault, Rubrik) -- Does Chaos Vaccination / Time-Locks change the comparison?
    7. **Enterprise Storage** (NetApp, Pure, Dell) -- Does VDE performance analysis change the comparison?
    8. **Data Infrastructure** (Redis, MongoDB, Elastic, Kafka, Spark) -- Does Semantic Sync or Universal Tags change the comparison?
    9. **Hyperscaler Internal** (Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix) -- Any change?
    10. **HPC/AI** (NVIDIA, Lustre, WEKA) -- Any change?
    11. **Specialized** (SeisComP, etc.) -- Any change?

    **C. New Competitive Dimensions from Moonshots:**

    Assess whether any moonshot feature creates a NEW competitive advantage not available in any competitor:
    - Data Consciousness (AI value/liability scoring) -- who else does this?
    - Compliance Passports (per-object certification) -- who else does this?
    - Carbon-Aware Tiering (energy measurement + GHG reporting) -- who else does this?
    - Chaos Vaccination (automated fault injection with immune memory) -- Netflix Chaos Monkey comparison
    - Crypto Time-Locks (ransomware vaccination) -- who else combines PQC + time-locks?

    **D. Updated Position Matrix:**

    Reproduce the v4.5 position matrix with v5.0 grades:

    | Dimension | v4.5 Grade | v5.0 Grade | Delta | Notes |
    |-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|
    | Architecture | Excellent | ? | ? | |
    | Feature Breadth | Exceptional | ? | ? | |
    | Security (Design) | Strong | ? | ? | |
    | Security (Proven) | Very Weak | ? | ? | |
    | Scalability | Designed | ? | ? | |
    | etc. | | | | |

    Write `.planning/phases/67-certification/67-06-COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md` with:
    - Executive summary: overall competitive position improvement from v4.5 to v5.0
    - v5.0 delta summary
    - Updated analysis for all 11 categories
    - New competitive advantages from moonshots
    - Updated position matrix
    - "Where DataWarehouse Genuinely Leads" (updated)
    - "Where DataWarehouse Must Still Improve" (updated)
    - Honest acknowledgment of the production track record gap

    CRITICAL: Maintain the same brutal honesty as the v4.5 analysis. Do NOT inflate claims. If a moonshot is stubs, say so. If production track record is still zero, say so.
