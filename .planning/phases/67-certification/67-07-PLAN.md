<objective>
Issue formal v5.0-CERTIFICATION.md synthesizing all audit results into domain verdicts, tier verdicts, and an overall CERTIFIED/NOT CERTIFIED verdict. If any FAIL: generate remediation plan.

Purpose: This is the final certification gate for v5.0. It must be hostile -- actively seeking reasons to FAIL certification, not rubber-stamping. The certifier accepts accountability for the verdict.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Synthesize Audit Results into Certification Verdicts</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/67-certification/v5.0-CERTIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>
    Synthesize ALL audit results from Plans 01-06 into a formal certification document.

    **Document Structure:**

    ```
    # DataWarehouse v5.0 Certification Authority Final Audit

    **Issued:** [date]
    **Certifier:** Phase 67 Certification Authority (Claude Opus 4.6)
    **Iteration:** v5.0 (previous: v4.0, v4.2, v4.3, v4.5)
    **Accountability:** The certifier accepts full accountability for this verdict.

    ## VERDICT: [CERTIFIED / NOT CERTIFIED]

    **Rationale:** [2-3 paragraph summary of why]

    ## Part 1: Audit Results Summary

    ### 1.1 Audit Phase Results

    | Audit | Scope | Grade | Key Findings |
    |-------|-------|-------|-------------|
    | 67-01 Build Health | Build, plugins, registration | | |
    | 67-02 Security | 50 findings re-verify, new scan | | |
    | 67-03 Features | 3,549 features, 10 moonshots | | |
    | 67-04 E2E Flows | 20+ critical paths | | |
    | 67-05 Performance | Static analysis, bottlenecks | | |
    | 67-06 Competitive | 70+ products | | |

    ### 1.2 Domain Certification (17+ Domains)

    Update the v4.5 domain table with v5.0 verdicts:

    | # | Domain | v4.5 Verdict | v5.0 Verdict | Delta | Blocking Issues |
    |---|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|----------------|
    | 1 | Data Pipeline | PASS | ? | | |
    | 2 | Storage & Persistence | FAIL | ? | | |
    | 3 | Security & Cryptography | FAIL | ? | | |
    ...through all 17+ domains.

    Add new domains for moonshot features if they warrant separate certification:
    - Data Consciousness
    - Compliance Passports
    - Zero-Gravity Storage
    - Crypto Time-Locks
    - Semantic Sync
    - Chaos Vaccination
    - Carbon-Aware Tiering
    - Universal Fabric

    ### 1.3 Tier Certification (7 Tiers)

    Update the v4.5 tier table:

    | Tier | v4.5 Verdict | v5.0 Verdict | Delta | Blocking Issues |
    |------|-------------|-------------|-------|----------------|
    | 1 Individual | PASS | ? | | |
    | 2 SMB | CONDITIONAL | ? | | |
    ...through all 7 tiers.

    ### 1.4 v4.5 P0 Items Resolution Status

    For each of the 13 P0 items from v4.5, final resolution status:

    | P0 | Issue | v4.5 Status | v5.0 Status | Evidence |
    |----|-------|------------|------------|---------|

    ### 1.5 Code Quality Assessment

    Updated from v4.5 with actual numbers:
    - Build: errors, warnings
    - Tests: total, passed, failed, real coverage %
    - Plugins: count, SDK-only compliance
    - Strategies: count, base class compliance
    - Sync-over-async: count remaining
    - TODOs: count remaining
    - Placeholder tests: count remaining

    ## Part 2: Competitive Position (Summary)

    Brief competitive position summary referencing 67-06 for full analysis.

    ---

    ## Part 3: Hostile Certification Challenge

    **TARGET: Find valid reasons for NOT certifying.**

    Actively seek weaknesses:
    1. What would a hostile auditor flag?
    2. What would a competitor point to?
    3. What would a customer refuse to accept?
    4. What would a security researcher exploit?
    5. What would a performance engineer reject?

    For each reason found: assess severity (blocks certification / weakens but does not block / acceptable risk).

    ---

    ## Part 4: Certification Conditions

    If CERTIFIED:
    - List any conditions / known limitations
    - List recommended improvements for v6.0

    If NOT CERTIFIED:
    - Mandatory remediation plan (specific tasks with files)
    - Recommended remediation
    - Target iteration for re-certification

    ---

    **Certification Authority Signature**
    ```

    **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS for the certifier:**

    1. Be HOSTILE, not friendly. The goal is to FIND reasons to FAIL, not to rubber-stamp.
    2. Every claim must be backed by evidence from Plans 01-06 audits.
    3. Do NOT trust phase summaries -- only trust audit results that searched actual code.
    4. The v4.5 certification found 8 CRITICAL vulnerabilities. Verify EACH is actually fixed.
    5. If ANY critical security finding remains unresolved, verdict MUST be NOT CERTIFIED.
    6. Production track record is still zero -- acknowledge this but do not use it as sole reason to fail (it is architectural certification, not operational certification).
    7. The second certification target is to find valid reasons for NOT certifying. Take this seriously.

    Write the complete `.planning/phases/67-certification/v5.0-CERTIFICATION.md`.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Certification document exists with: verdict, all domain verdicts, all tier verdicts, P0 resolution status, hostile challenge section, and conditions. If NOT CERTIFIED, remediation plan exists.
  </verify>
  <done>
    v5.0-CERTIFICATION.md exists as a formal, accountable certification document with evidence-based PASS/FAIL per domain, per tier, and overall. Hostile challenge section completed. Remediation plan included if needed.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- All 17+ domains have verdicts
- All 7 tiers have verdicts
- All 13 P0 items have resolution status
- Hostile challenge section has specific findings
- Overall verdict is stated with rationale
- If NOT CERTIFIED: remediation plan is actionable
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Formal certification document that a hostile third-party auditor would respect. Every verdict backed by evidence. No hand-waving. No inflated claims. Accountable certifier signature. If the codebase deserves CERTIFIED, it gets it. If it does not, it gets NOT CERTIFIED with a clear path to certification.
</success_criteria>
