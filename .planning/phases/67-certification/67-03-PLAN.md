<objective>
Verify ALL 3,549 features at 100% completeness, verify all 10 moonshots are wired and working, and audit user configurability across all feature domains.

Purpose: Confirm v5.0 delivers on its promise of zero features below 100% and all moonshot innovations wired. Verify every feature is user-configurable.

  <name>Task 1: Feature Completeness Verification</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/67-certification/67-03-FEATURE-AUDIT.md</files>
  <action>
    Perform a comprehensive feature completeness audit across all 17 domains and 10 moonshots:

    **A. Domain-by-Domain Feature Audit (17 domains):**

    For each of the 17 domains from the v4.5 certification (Data Pipeline, Storage and Persistence, Security and Cryptography, Media and Format, Distributed, Hardware, Edge Computing, AEDS, Air-Gap, Filesystem, Compute, Transport, Intelligence, Observability, Governance, Cloud, CLI/GUI):

    1. Count strategy classes per plugin in that domain
    2. Search for placeholder patterns: `throw new NotImplementedException`, `// TODO`, `// HACK`, `// PLACEHOLDER`, `// STUB`, `Assert.True(true)` in non-test code, empty method bodies in non-abstract classes
    3. Verify key capabilities are implemented (not just interfaces declared)
    4. Grade each domain: percentage of strategies with real implementations

    **B. Moonshot Verification (10 moonshots from Phases 55-63):**

    Verify each moonshot has working code (not just SDK contracts):

    1. **Universal Tag System** (Phase 55): TagSchema, TagStore, TagPropagationEngine, TagPolicyEngine, TagQueryApi exist with real logic
    2. **Data Consciousness** (Phase 56): ValueScorer, LiabilityAssessor, DarkDataDiscovery, AutoArchiver exist with real logic
    3. **Compliance Passports** (Phase 57): CompliancePassport model, SovereigntyZone, CrossBorderProtocol exist with real logic
    4. **Zero-Gravity Storage** (Phase 58): CRUSH placement, VDE parallelism, SIMD bitmap, Rebalancer exist with real logic
    5. **Crypto Time-Locks** (Phase 59): TimeLockPolicy, PQC algorithms (Kyber/Dilithium/SPHINCS+), CryptoAgilityEngine exist with real logic
    6. **Semantic Sync** (Phase 60): SemanticSyncEngine, SummaryRouter, SemanticConflictResolver exist with real logic
    7. **Chaos Vaccination** (Phase 61): FaultInjector, BlastRadiusEnforcer, ImmuneMemory, VaccinationSchedule exist with real logic
    8. **Carbon-Aware Tiering** (Phase 62): EnergyMeter, CarbonBudget, RenewablePlacement, GhgReporter exist with real logic
    9. **Universal Fabric + S3** (Phase 63): DwNamespace, S3Server, CrossLanguageSDK exist with real logic
    10. **Moonshot Integration** (Phase 64): Cross-moonshot wiring, interaction verification

    For each moonshot: count classes, count methods with real bodies (>5 lines), count placeholder/stub methods, verdict WIRED/PARTIAL/STUB.

    **C. User Configurability Audit:**

    For each plugin:
    1. Search for Options/Settings classes (e.g., `*Options`, `*Settings`, `*Configuration`)
    2. Verify options are exposed through IConfiguration binding
    3. Check that preset tiers (minimal, standard, enterprise, god-tier) configure each feature
    4. Flag any feature that is hardcoded without user override

    **D. Stub/Placeholder Census:**

    Exhaustive search across entire codebase for:
    - `NotImplementedException` (excluding abstract/interface)
    - `// TODO` markers
    - `// HACK` markers
    - `// PLACEHOLDER`
    - `// STUB`
    - Empty method bodies (method with only `{ }` or `{ return; }`)
    - `Assert.True(true)` in test files

    Count and categorize by plugin/domain.

    Write `.planning/phases/67-certification/67-03-FEATURE-AUDIT.md` with:
    - Executive summary (feature score, moonshot score)
    - Per-domain feature table (17 rows): Domain | Strategies | Real Impl | Stubs | Score | Verdict
    - Per-moonshot table (10 rows): Moonshot | Classes | Real Methods | Stubs | Wired | Verdict
    - Configurability audit table: Plugin | Options Class | Config Bound | Preset Coverage | Verdict
    - Stub/Placeholder census totals
    - Comparison to v4.5 baseline
    - PASS/FAIL verdict
  </action>
  <verify>
    Grep for `NotImplementedException` returns count. Grep for `// TODO` returns count. Each moonshot directory contains real implementation files (not just interfaces). Audit document contains all tables.
  </verify>
  <done>
    67-03-FEATURE-AUDIT.md exists with: domain scores, moonshot verdicts, configurability audit, stub census, and overall PASS/FAIL. All claims backed by actual code search results.
  </done>

<verification>
- All 17 domains have feature scores
- All 10 moonshots have WIRED/PARTIAL/STUB verdicts
- Stub census covers entire codebase
- Configurability checked for all plugins
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Feature audit covers every domain and moonshot with evidence-based verdicts. No claims based on phase summaries alone -- all verified by searching actual source files. Stub/placeholder census is exhaustive.
