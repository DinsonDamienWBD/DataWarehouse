<objective>
Consolidate Filesystem Drivers + Compute Plugins (4 plugins merged into 2 existing plugins, net -4).

1. Merge FuseDriver into UltimateFilesystem as UnixFuseFilesystemStrategy
2. Merge WinFspDriver into UltimateFilesystem as WindowsWinFspFilesystemStrategy
3. Merge Compute.Wasm into UltimateCompute as WasmRuntimeStrategy (+ 31 language strategies)
4. Merge SelfEmulatingObjects into UltimateCompute as SelfEmulatingComputeStrategy

For each merge:
- Move strategy classes from source plugin to target plugin's Strategies/ folder
- Update namespaces
- Register new strategies in target plugin's OnStartCoreAsync
- Delete source plugin project directory
- Remove from .slnx

Build verify: `dotnet build DataWarehouse.slnx` — zero errors.
