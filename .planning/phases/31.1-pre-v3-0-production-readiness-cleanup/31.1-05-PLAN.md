# Plan 31.1-05: Batch 2 Data Management Plugins — Group B (8 plugins)

## Goal
Implement real production-ready strategy method bodies for the remaining 8 Batch 2 Data Management plugins. (UltimateDeployment moved to Plan 31.1-02.)

## Plugins

### 8. UltimateDataLake (~40 strategies)
Replace placeholder lake operations with real implementations:
- Zone management: Bronze/Silver/Gold medallion with promotion rules
- Schema-on-read: dynamic schema inference from JSON/CSV/Parquet headers
- Data cataloging: metadata extraction and indexing
- Lake-to-warehouse sync: incremental materialization

### 9. UltimateDataLineage (~32 strategies)
Replace placeholder lineage operations with real graph tracking:
- Origin tracking: source system registration with connection metadata
- Transformation tracking: DAG construction from ETL job definitions
- Impact analysis: reverse graph traversal for blast radius calculation
- Provenance chain: SHA-256 hash chain for tamper detection

### 10. UltimateDataManagement (~74 strategies)
Note: Some strategies already have REAL implementations (InlineDeduplication with rolling hash). Replace remaining placeholders:
- Deduplication: content-defined chunking with Rabin fingerprinting
- Retention: policy evaluation engine with time-based expiry
- Versioning: delta-based version storage with parent chain
- Tiering: cost-aware data placement with access frequency tracking

### 11. UltimateDataMesh (~55 strategies)
Replace placeholder mesh operations with real domain management:
- Domain ownership: bounded context registration and lifecycle
- Data products: SLA tracking, quality metrics, versioned contracts
- Federated governance: policy-as-code evaluation across domains
- Cross-domain sharing: contract validation and event-driven federation

### 12. UltimateDataPrivacy (~70 strategies)
Replace placeholder privacy operations with real transformations:
- Anonymization: k-anonymity via generalization/suppression
- Pseudonymization: HMAC-based deterministic replacement
- Tokenization: format-preserving encryption (FPE) using AES-FF1
- Data masking: pattern-based field masking (SSN, email, phone)
- Differential privacy: Laplace noise addition with epsilon budgeting

### 13. UltimateDataProtection (~40 strategies — orchestration-level)
Note: Innovation strategy simulated operations are handled in Plan 31.1-02. These are the core backup/recovery strategy bodies:
- Full backup: streaming file copy with progress tracking
- Incremental: journal-based change detection with block-level deltas
- CDP: write-ahead log capture for continuous protection
- Snapshot: copy-on-write with reference counting

### 14. UltimateDataQuality (~50 strategies)
Replace placeholder quality operations with real validation:
- Validation: regex/range/constraint checking against schema rules
- Profiling: statistical analysis (min/max/mean/stddev/percentiles/cardinality)
- Cleansing: whitespace normalization, case standardization, null handling
- Duplicate detection: Levenshtein distance + Soundex for fuzzy matching
- Quality scoring: weighted dimension scoring (completeness, accuracy, consistency)

### 15. UltimateDataTransit (~6 strategies — protocol bodies)
Note: Orchestration is already REAL (scoring, QoS, cost routing, layering). Replace strategy transfer method placeholders:
- HTTP/2: real HttpClient with multiplexed streams
- gRPC: real Grpc.Net.Client bidirectional streaming
- FTP/SFTP: real FtpClient/SftpClient using .NET sockets
- SCP: real SSH-based file transfer

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 8 Batch 2 plugins' strategy methods contain real production logic
- [ ] No placeholder return values remain
- [ ] Full solution builds with 0 new errors
- [ ] PLUGIN-CATALOG.md updated for each plugin
