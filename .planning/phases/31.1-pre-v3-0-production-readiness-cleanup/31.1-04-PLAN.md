# Plan 31.1-04: Batch 2 Data Management Plugins — Group A (7 plugins)

## Goal
Implement real production-ready strategy method bodies for the first 7 of 15 Batch 2 Data Management plugins. These plugins all have production-ready orchestration layers (message bus, auto-discovery, intelligence integration) but skeleton strategy bodies that return placeholder results.

## Approach
Each strategy body needs real logic replacing `return placeholder`. The pattern is consistent: ParseAsync, SerializeAsync, TransferAsync, BackupAsync, etc. return defaults. Replace with real algorithms, data structures, and I/O operations. No new NuGet dependencies — use .NET BCL APIs.

## Plugins

### 1. UltimateDatabaseProtocol (~50 strategies)
Replace placeholder wire protocol encoding/decoding with real binary protocol implementations:
- **Relational**: PostgreSQL v3 wire protocol (startup, query, parse/bind/execute, copy), MySQL client/server (handshake, COM_QUERY, prepared statements), TDS for SQL Server
- **NoSQL**: MongoDB wire protocol (OP_MSG, OP_QUERY), Redis RESP3 (inline, bulk string, array), Cassandra CQL binary v4
- **Time-Series**: InfluxDB line protocol, Prometheus remote write protobuf
- **Graph**: Neo4j Bolt protocol, Gremlin bytecode
- **Search**: Elasticsearch transport, OpenSearch

### 2. UltimateDatabaseStorage (~45 strategies)
Replace placeholder storage operations with real CRUD implementations:
- Use ADO.NET patterns (DbConnection, DbCommand) for relational databases
- Use document-model patterns for NoSQL (JSON documents with indexing)
- Use key-value patterns for cache stores
- File-backed implementations for embedded databases (SQLite, DuckDB)

### 3. UltimateDataCatalog (~80 strategies)
Replace placeholder catalog operations with real metadata management:
- Asset discovery: file system scanning, database metadata queries
- Schema registry: schema versioning with compatibility checking
- Search: in-memory full-text index with TF-IDF scoring
- Data relationships: directed graph with cycle detection

### 4. UltimateDataFabric (~13 strategies)
Replace placeholder fabric operations with real topology and routing:
- Topology management: graph-based node tracking
- Data virtualization: query rewriting and result merging
- Mesh integration: domain registration and data product catalog

### 5. UltimateDataFormat (~10 strategies — non-stub ones)
Note: The 14 stub strategies needing external libraries are handled in Plan 31.1-03. These ~10 are the orchestration-level strategies that need real format routing logic.

### 6. UltimateDataGovernance (~70 strategies)
Replace placeholder governance operations with real policy engines:
- Policy enforcement: rule evaluation against data metadata
- Classification: pattern-based sensitivity detection (PII, PHI, PCI)
- Ownership: RACI matrix tracking
- Retention: time-based lifecycle with legal hold support

### 7. UltimateDataIntegration (~70 strategies)
Replace placeholder integration operations with real ETL/ELT pipelines:
- ETL: extract (file/stream reading), transform (type conversion, mapping), load (stream writing)
- CDC: timestamp-based change detection, journal-based log tailing
- Schema evolution: forward/backward compatibility checking with field mapping

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 7 plugins' strategy methods contain real production logic
- [ ] No placeholder return values remain
- [ ] Full solution builds with 0 new errors
- [ ] PLUGIN-CATALOG.md updated for each plugin
