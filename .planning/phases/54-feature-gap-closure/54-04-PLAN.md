<objective>
Quick Wins: Domains 14-16 (Observability, Governance, Cloud) — 551 features at 80-99% pushed to 100%.

Purpose: Domain 15 (Governance) alone has 392 production-ready features at 80-99% — the largest quick-win batch. Domain 16 (Cloud) has 104, and Domain 14 (Observability) has 55. These are the fastest path to closing a massive number of feature gaps.

Output: 551 features at 100% across observability, governance, compliance, privacy, lineage, quality, deployment, and multi-cloud plugins.

Apply 7-point production readiness checklist to 447 features.

**Domain 14 — Observability (55 features at 80-99%)**:
- Metrics exporters (Prometheus, Datadog, CloudWatch, New Relic, Dynatrace): Add push gateway support, custom metric namespaces, metric aggregation windows, label/tag validation
- Logging backends (ELK, Loki, Papertrail, Loggly): Add log level filtering, structured log format validation, log rotation triggers, buffer flush on shutdown
- Tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, Tempo): Add trace sampling configuration, baggage propagation, span attribute limits, trace context injection
- APM (Application Insights, New Relic APM): Add transaction naming, custom metrics, error grouping
- Alerting (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Slack, Teams): Add alert deduplication, escalation policies, maintenance windows
- Health checks: Add deep health (dependencies), shallow health (self), startup probes, liveness probes

**Domain 15 — Governance (392 features at 80-99%)**:
- Compliance (160+ strategies): GDPR consent tracking, HIPAA audit trails, PCI DSS encryption verification, SOC 2 control mapping, FedRAMP boundary enforcement, ISO 27001 control evidence — add continuous monitoring integration, compliance drift detection, remediation tracking
- Privacy (50+ strategies): Anonymization quality metrics, pseudonymization key rotation, tokenization vault health, masking pattern validation, differential privacy epsilon tracking — add privacy impact scoring, consent withdrawal propagation
- Lineage (30+ strategies): BFS traversal optimization, upstream/downstream impact analysis, lineage graph persistence, change propagation tracking — add lineage versioning, impact blast radius calculation
- Quality (40+ strategies): Data profiling accuracy, anomaly detection sensitivity, freshness monitoring, completeness scoring — add quality SLA enforcement, automated remediation triggers
- Protection (40+ strategies): Backup verification, retention policy enforcement, recovery point tracking — add backup integrity verification, recovery drill scheduling
- Catalog (30+ strategies): Asset discovery, classification tagging, ownership tracking — add catalog search indexing, asset relationship mapping
- Governance policies (42+ strategies): Policy versioning, approval workflows, exception tracking — add policy effectiveness metrics, compliance scoring

Pattern: Governance strategies at 85%+ typically need: audit trail emission for all operations, policy evaluation caching with TTL, configuration hot-reload support, and compliance report generation hooks.

Apply 7-point production readiness checklist to 104 Domain 16 features at 80-99%.

Focus areas:
- **Deployment patterns (20)**: Blue/green cutover validation, canary traffic percentage ramp, rolling update batch size, A/B test metric collection, shadow deployment diff analysis — add deployment rollback triggers, health gate checks between stages
- **Container orchestration (15)**: Kubernetes resource limits, pod disruption budgets, horizontal pod autoscaler metrics, namespace isolation — add Helm chart validation, KEDA scaling rules
- **CI/CD (10)**: Pipeline stage gates, artifact versioning, environment promotion rules — add pipeline telemetry, failure notification
- **Secrets management (8)**: Secret rotation scheduling, access audit, encryption-at-rest verification — add secret leak detection, expiry alerting
- **Config management (8)**: Config versioning, validation schemas, hot-reload support — add config drift detection, rollback capability
- **Infrastructure as Code (8)**: Template validation, drift detection, plan/apply separation — add cost estimation, resource tagging
- **Serverless (8)**: Cold start optimization, memory sizing, timeout configuration — add invocation metrics, cost tracking
- **Multi-cloud (27)**: AWS/Azure/GCP/Alibaba/Oracle adapter health probes, cross-cloud replication conflict resolution, failover trigger thresholds, cost optimization recommendations — add cloud cost anomaly detection, regional availability monitoring

Pattern: Deployment strategies at 85%+ need: proper rollback capability, health gate validation, metrics emission for deployment duration/success-rate, and configuration validation for all deployment parameters.
