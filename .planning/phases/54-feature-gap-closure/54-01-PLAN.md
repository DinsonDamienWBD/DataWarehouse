<objective>
Quick Wins: Domain 1 (Data Pipeline) + Domain 2 (Storage) — 202 features at 80-99% pushed to 100%.

Purpose: Close the largest batch of near-complete features first. These 202 features need only polish work: config validation, health checks, resource management, graceful shutdown, metrics emission, error boundary handling, and edge case coverage.

Output: 202 features at 100% across compression, streaming, storage, RAID, and database storage plugins.

CRITICAL: Before modifying ANY strategy, verify it was not already completed in Phase 50.1. The 51 features at 90-94% were already hardened in Phase 50.1 — check those SUMMARY files first.

For each of the 78 Domain 1 features at 80-99%, apply the 7-point production readiness checklist:
1. Config validation — all configuration parameters validated on startup with clear error messages
2. Health checks — each strategy reports health status via bus
3. Resource management — IDisposable properly implemented, ArrayPool/MemoryPool used for buffers
4. Graceful shutdown — CancellationToken respected throughout, pending operations complete cleanly
5. Metrics emission — operation count, latency, error rate emitted via observability bus topics
6. Error boundaries — all operations wrapped in try/catch, errors logged with context, fallback behavior defined
7. Edge case handling — empty input, null values, oversized data, concurrent access all handled

Focus areas by sub-domain:
- **Compression transit strategies (8)**: Ensure proper streaming support, chunked compression/decompression
- **Core compression algorithms (19)**: Dictionary management, compression level configuration, memory limits
- **Domain-specific compression (10)**: Format-specific optimizations, content-type detection
- **Streaming strategies (3)**: MQTT QoS 2, Kafka consumer groups, checkpointing
- **Archive formats (7)**: Multi-entry archives, progress reporting, extraction error recovery
- **Delta compression (5)**: Binary diff/patch, rolling hash, signature generation
- **Entropy coding (6)**: Symbol table management, adaptive models, flush semantics
- **Transform algorithms (3)**: Block-size configuration, in-place transforms where possible
- **Emerging/context mixing/generative (15)**: Ensure all have proper fallback when specialized hardware unavailable

Pattern: For strategies already at 90%+, the gap is typically missing ConfigureAwait(false), missing CancellationToken propagation, or missing health check registration. Apply mechanically.

CRITICAL: Before modifying ANY strategy, verify it was not already completed in Phase 50.1. Check Phase 50.1 SUMMARY files for iSCSI, Fibre Channel, S3-Generic, RAID 0/1/5/6/10 — these were already hardened.

For each of the 124 Domain 2 features at 80-99%, apply the same 7-point production readiness checklist.

Focus areas by sub-domain:
- **Cloud storage providers (37)**: Connection pooling, retry with exponential backoff, region failover, credential rotation support
- **S3-compatible storage (15)**: Multipart upload, presigned URLs, server-side encryption, bucket policies
- **Database connectors (25)**: Connection string validation, connection pool limits, query timeout, prepared statement caching
- **RAID standard levels (15)**: Rebuild progress tracking, hot spare activation, scrub scheduling, parity verification
- **Database storage strategies (20)**: Index management, compaction, vacuum scheduling, snapshot isolation
- **Filesystem features (8)**: Inode management, journal recovery, quota enforcement
- **Distributed filesystems (4)**: Node health monitoring, rebalance triggers, split-brain protection

Pattern: Most storage strategies at 85%+ need proper connection lifecycle (connect/verify/disconnect), health probes (can-read, can-write, latency-check), and configuration validation (endpoint format, auth credential presence).

Architectural rule: All storage strategies MUST delegate hashing to UltimateDataIntegrity via bus, encryption to UltimateEncryption via bus. Do NOT add inline crypto.
