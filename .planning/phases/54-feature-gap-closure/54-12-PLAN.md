<objective>
Cross-Domain Integration Verification — Verify all Phase 54 work, re-score feature matrix, document remaining gaps.

Purpose: After 11 plans of feature gap closure, verify the entire codebase compiles, tests pass, no regressions occurred, and produce an updated feature verification matrix showing the improvement from Phase 54. Document any remaining features below 100% for potential follow-up phases.

Output: Updated v5.0 Feature Verification Matrix, Phase 54 Verification Report, remaining gap inventory.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build Verification + Test Suite + Architecture Audit</name>
  <files>
    .planning/phases/54-feature-gap-closure/54-VERIFICATION.md
  </files>
  <action>
Run comprehensive verification of all Phase 54 work.

**Step 1: Full Build Verification**
```bash
dotnet build DataWarehouse.slnx
```
Must produce: 0 errors, 0 warnings across all projects.

**Step 2: Full Test Suite**
```bash
dotnet test DataWarehouse.slnx
```
Must produce: all existing tests passing, 0 failures, 0 skipped.

**Step 3: Architecture Audit (AD-11 Capability Delegation)**
Search for violations of the capability delegation rule:
- grep for SHA256.Create, SHA384.Create, SHA512.Create, HMACSHA256 OUTSIDE of UltimateDataIntegrity
- grep for Aes.Create, AesGcm, RSA.Create, ECDsa.Create OUTSIDE of UltimateEncryption
- grep for new HttpClient() for data transfer OUTSIDE of UltimateDataTransit (SharedHttpClient for API calls is OK)
- Exception: AWS Signature V4 HMAC in UniversalObservability is protocol-specific (allowed)

Document any violations found.

**Step 4: Anti-Pattern Audit**
- grep for GetAwaiter().GetResult() — count and verify all are in Dispose() methods
- grep for TODO/FIXME/HACK/STUB/PLACEHOLDER — count by plugin
- grep for new MemoryStream() without capacity — should be zero
- grep for async void — should be zero
- grep for BinaryFormatter — should be zero
- grep for empty catch blocks — should be zero

**Step 5: NuGet Package Audit**
Verify all new NuGet packages added in Phase 54 are:
- Pinned to specific versions (no floating ranges)
- From trusted sources (nuget.org only)
- No known vulnerabilities (dotnet list package --vulnerable)

**Step 6: Produce Verification Report**
Create 54-VERIFICATION.md with:
- Build status (errors, warnings)
- Test results (passed, failed, skipped)
- Architecture violations found
- Anti-pattern counts
- NuGet audit results
- Overall Phase 54 assessment

  </files>
  <action>
Re-score the feature verification matrix after Phase 54 work.

**Step 1: Re-Score Each Domain**
For each of the 17 domains, re-count features by score range:
- 100% (fully complete)
- 80-99% (near-complete)
- 50-79% (partial)
- 20-49% (scaffolding)
- 1-19% (metadata-only)
- 0% (not started)

Method: Read SUMMARY files from Plans 01-11 to understand what was completed. Cross-reference with original v4.5 matrix to calculate deltas.

**Step 2: Produce v5.0 Matrix**
Create v5.0-MATRIX.md with:
- Executive summary (total features, overall average score, improvement from v4.5)
- Domain-by-domain scores with v4.5 comparison
- Score distribution histogram
- Quick wins remaining (if any)
- Top 10 most improved domains
- Remaining gaps summary

**Step 3: Remaining Gap Inventory**
For features still below 100%, categorize:
- Features at 80-99% (need polish)
- Features at 50-79% (need significant work)
- Features at <50% (need major implementation)
- Features intentionally deferred (with rationale: hardware-dependent, niche, RTOS, etc.)

**Step 4: Recommendations**
Based on remaining gaps, recommend:
- Whether Phase 54 follow-up plans are needed
- Which domains need additional phases
- Estimated plan count for full 100% closure
- Priority ordering for remaining gaps

Format the matrix as a comprehensive Markdown document that can serve as the v5.0 quality certification baseline.
