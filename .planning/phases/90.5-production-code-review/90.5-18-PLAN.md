<objective>
Production Code Review and Gap Closure for CLI, GUI, Launcher, and Shared projects.

Purpose: These are the user-facing entry points. Stubs here mean commands that don't work, buttons that do nothing, and a launcher that doesn't start the system properly.

Output: Zero-gap frontend projects with comprehensive wiring documentation.

    **MANDATORY PER-FILE REPORTING RULE:**
    Every single .cs file in the project directory MUST be individually listed in the findings report. No exceptions, no summarization across files. For each file report:
    - Full file path and total line count
    - Every finding (stub, no-op, gap, fake payload, TODO) with exact line number(s) and code snippet
    - If the file has zero issues, explicitly list it as: "filename.cs (N lines) — CLEAN, no issues"
    
    Do NOT skip any file. Do NOT group files together. Do NOT say "similar pattern in X files".
    Go through every line of code in every file. We are closing all gaps once and for all.
    Perform exhaustive scan of all four projects for:
    1. NotImplementedException / NotSupportedException throws
    2. Task.CompletedTask / Task.FromResult no-ops
    3. CLI commands that print "not implemented" or similar
    4. GUI event handlers that don't call backend
    5. Launcher steps that are skipped or stubbed
    6. Shared utilities with placeholder logic
    7. TODO/FIXME comments

    Present findings grouped by project.

    Implement all fixes:
    1. **CLI**: Every command must call the appropriate kernel/plugin API
    2. **GUI**: Every handler must connect to real backend operations
    3. **Launcher**: Boot sequence must fully initialize kernel and all plugins
    4. **Shared**: All utility functions must have real implementations

    - **GUI**: Screen/view inventory, which backend operations each screen triggers
    - **Launcher**: Full boot sequence from Main() to running system
