<objective>
Zero-Stub Final Certification Scan across the ENTIRE solution.

Purpose: After all 18 prior plans have closed gaps in their respective projects, this plan performs a final comprehensive scan of the ENTIRE codebase to catch anything missed, any regressions from cross-project fixes, and produces the official certification report.

Output: Certification report proving zero stubs + Master wiring document synthesizing all individual wiring docs.

    **MANDATORY PER-FILE REPORTING RULE:**
    Every single .cs file in the project directory MUST be individually listed in the findings report. No exceptions, no summarization across files. For each file report:
    - Full file path and total line count
    - Every finding (stub, no-op, gap, fake payload, TODO) with exact line number(s) and code snippet
    - If the file has zero issues, explicitly list it as: "filename.cs (N lines) — CLEAN, no issues"
    
    Do NOT skip any file. Do NOT group files together. Do NOT say "similar pattern in X files".
    Go through every line of code in every file. We are closing all gaps once and for all.
    Run automated scans across the ENTIRE solution:

    1. **NotImplementedException scan**: `grep -rn "NotImplementedException" --include="*.cs"` across all projects
    2. **NotSupportedException scan**: Same, then cross-reference each against documented capability guards
    3. **Task.CompletedTask scan**: `grep -rn "Task\.CompletedTask" --include="*.cs"`
    4. **Task.FromResult scan**: `grep -rn "Task\.FromResult" --include="*.cs"` (check each for no-op patterns)
    5. **Fake payload scan**: `grep -rn "new byte\[" --include="*.cs"` for suspicious large arrays
    6. **TODO/FIXME scan**: `grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|PLACEHOLDER\|STUB" --include="*.cs"`
    7. **Build verification**: `dotnet build DataWarehouse.slnx` must succeed with zero warnings

    Present results as a certification table:

    | Category | Count | Status |
    |----------|-------|--------|
    | NotImplementedException | 0 | PASS |
    | NotSupportedException (stubs) | 0 | PASS |
    | NotSupportedException (guards) | N | DOCUMENTED |
    | Task.CompletedTask (no-ops) | 0 | PASS |
    | Fake payloads | 0 | PASS |
    | TODO/FIXME | 0 | PASS |
    | Build warnings | 0 | PASS |

    If ANY non-zero counts in PASS categories: list each finding for remediation.

    7. Sign-off: Ready for production

    **00-MASTER-WIRING.md**: Synthesize all 18 individual wiring documents into one master:

    3. Control flow: How commands propagate through the system
