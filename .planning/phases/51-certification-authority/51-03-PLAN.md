# Plan 51-03: Formal Certification

## Role
You are the **Certification Authority**. This is the formal certification issuance.

## Goal
Issue the formal `CERTIFICATION.md` document certifying DataWarehouse as production-ready for all specified customer tiers and capability domains.

## Prerequisites
- `.planning/CERTIFICATION-AUDIT.md` Section 8 Final Verdict: **READY FOR CERTIFICATION**
- Build: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Tests: 100% pass
- All 63 plugins: PASS or documented CONDITIONAL PASS
- All 10 critical flows: PASS
- All 17 domains: PASS
- All 7 tiers: PASS
- P0/P1 findings: 0

## Approach

### 1. Final Build Gate (Pre-certification verification)
Run one final verification:

```bash
dotnet build DataWarehouse.slnx --configuration Release
```
**MUST**: 0 errors, 0 warnings

```bash
dotnet test --verbosity normal
```
**MUST**: 100% pass rate

If either fails, STOP. Return to Plan 51-02 for remediation.

### 2. Verify Certification Readiness
Read `.planning/CERTIFICATION-AUDIT.md` and confirm:
- Section 8 Overall Verdict: ✅ **READY FOR CERTIFICATION**
- Section 7 Remaining Findings: P0 = 0, P1 = 0
- Section 2 Plugin Matrix: 0 FAIL
- Section 3 Flow Results: 10/10 PASS
- Section 4 Domain Certification: 17/17 PASS
- Section 5 Tier Certification: 7/7 PASS
- Section 6 Convergence: 100%

If ANY gate is not met, STOP. Return to Plan 51-02.

### 3. Issue Formal Certification
Create `CERTIFICATION.md` in the project root directory:

```markdown
# DataWarehouse v4.0 — Universal Production Certification

## Formal Certification Document

## Known Limitations (Intentional)

### 1. Future Hardware Strategies (Documented Forward-Compatibility)
The following strategies are intentional forward-compatibility placeholders for future hardware:
1. **QuantumCryptoStrategy** (UltimateEncryption) — quantum-resistant algorithms
2. **DnaStorageStrategy** (UltimateStorage) — DNA-based storage
3. **PhotonicAcceleratorStrategy** (UltimateAcceleration) — photonic computing
4. **NeuromorphicIndexStrategy** (UltimateSearch) — neuromorphic chips
5. **CryogenicCacheStrategy** (UltimateCache) — cryogenic memory

**Rationale**: These enable graceful adoption of emerging technologies without breaking changes.
**Impact**: No impact on current functionality. Gracefully degrade to available implementations.
**Acceptable for v4.0**: YES

### 2. [Any other CONDITIONAL PASS items from 51-01-PLUGIN-AUDIT-MATRIX.md]

---

## v5.0+ Deferred Items

The following features were identified during v4.0 development but deferred to v5.0+:

[Reference the Feature Verification Matrix from v4.0-MILESTONE-DRAFT.md]
[List features at 0-49% readiness that were explicitly deferred]

Examples:
- AI-driven data classification (0% — requires ML pipeline)
- Cross-cluster geo-replication (25% — federation exists, geo-awareness deferred)
- [etc.]

**Rationale**: v4.0 scope was production readiness for core domains and all customer tiers. These features are enhancements for future milestones.

8. **Phase 50**: P2 remediation + re-audit (code quality, test gaps, docs, automated re-scan, domain spot-check)
9. **Phase 51-01**: Certification Authority full audit (plugins, flows, domains, tiers, convergence)
10. **Phase 51-02**: Final remediation (all remaining findings)
11. **Phase 51-03**: Formal certification (this document)

**Full audit evidence**: `.planning/CERTIFICATION-AUDIT.md` and all referenced files.
