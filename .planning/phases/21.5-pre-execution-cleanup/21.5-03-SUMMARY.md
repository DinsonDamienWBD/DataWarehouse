# Phase 21.5 Plan 03 Summary

Add 2 missing plugin projects (AirGapBridge and DataMarketplace) to DataWarehouse.slnx to achieve full solution completeness (69/69 projects).

## What Changed
- Added DataWarehouse.Plugins.AirGapBridge to /Plugins/ folder in solution (alphabetically after AedsCore)
- Added DataWarehouse.Plugins.DataMarketplace to /Plugins/ folder in solution (alphabetically after Compute.Wasm)
- Solution project count: 67 -> 69 (all projects on disk now in solution)
- AirGapBridge builds successfully (0 errors, 1107 warnings from analyzers)
- DataMarketplace has pre-existing analyzer errors (S2325, S1481, CA1869, etc.) from concurrent Phase 22 analyzer configuration -- these are not caused by this plan

## Deviations from Plan
None - plan executed exactly as written. DataMarketplace analyzer errors are pre-existing issues in the project source, not caused by adding it to the solution.

## Files Modified
- Modified: DataWarehouse.slnx

## Build Status
PARTIAL - AirGapBridge builds (0 errors). DataMarketplace has 37 analyzer errors from concurrent Phase 22 work adding analyzers. These are pre-existing code quality issues in the plugin source, not related to this plan.
