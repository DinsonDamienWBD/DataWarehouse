# Plan 50.1-06: Encryption + Key Management Production Hardening

## Status: COMPLETE

## What was built
Production-hardened 4 security strategies in Domain 03:
- AES-128-GCM, AES-192-GCM, AES-256-GCM encryption strategies
- PKCS#11 HSM key management strategy
- TPM 2.0 key management strategy

## Infrastructure added per strategy
1. InitializeAsyncCore with crypto parameter validation
2. Health checks with 60-second caching
3. Graceful shutdown with resource cleanup
4. Operation counters and error boundaries
