Consider each major task line by line.\nb. For each task, check each sub-task given the start and end sub-task numbers in brackets against each task)\nc. verify the sub-task in the actual code, and also check for full 100% production readiness\nd. If verification passes, mark it as complete.\ne. If verification does not pass due to any issue (not implemented, not production ready, stub, placeholder, simulation, mockup etc.), fix or implement it in a 100% production ready style. Once the sub-task implementation completed, go back to step c. to reverify this sub-task, and proceed from there.\nf. Once you have fully iterated ALL sub-tasks from the starting to the ending number as provided in the brackets against the main task, if all the sub-tasks are marked complete, only then mark the main task as complete.\n\n** There may be partial implementations, maybe in other plugins. Always check if any implementation exists, verify the right place for them to exist under (plugins focus on one domain - Encryption plugin does everything encryption but doesn't do Key management even though key management is needed for encryption. Key management is done by a separate plugin...). **\n** If a 100% production ready implementation exists in a standalone plugin, try to move/copy-paste it to the correct ultimate plugin, rather than having to implement it from scratch. **\n\nUse Ultrawork as needed.\n\nAs each sub-task is completed, verify the actual implementation in the codebase for 100% readiness.\nIf verification passes, mark the sub-task as complete.\nWhen ALL sub-tasks of a main task are marked complete, mark the main task as complete.\nAs each main task gets completed, commit and push. EVen if you say you have verified it, there are still tasks that show not completed.",
