  "original_prompt": "continue with the tasks. Due to hitting rate limit, multiple agents might have been killed in between, so first, commit any completed tasks and TODO.md updates. Next, check for any killed/stuck agents and resume their tasks. Use about 4 sub-agents and tasks tool and ultrawork as necessary. Make sure each component gets implemented in the correct ultimate plugin and only unique requirements stay as new standalone plugins. Also make sure the code is always 100% production ready without any mockups, simulations, placeholders, simplifications or missing logic and gaps. As each main task completes, commit and push the changes, making sure that the sub-tasks and main task are marked as complete (verify the actual codebase for the implementation, and mark as complete only if verification passes) to keep TODO.md in sync before committing and pushing.",
